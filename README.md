# Unconditionally-Stable-Fluid-diffusion
In numerical analysis, an algorithm is said to be unconditionally stable if it remains stable regardless of the choice of time step. This is crucial in fluid dynamics simulations because it allows us to ensure that our solutions remain accurate and stable, even as we advance in time. And I decided to put that concept to the test
